Just some stuff to learn about Git/Github
The tutorial told me to say something about
myself. The first programming language I 
used was TI-BASIC on my calculator. I made
some useful programs for my math class,
like a program to calculate, idk, is it 
called binomial expansion? It's the 
coefficients of (x + y)^n after it's 
multiplied out. So you would input the 
coefficients of x and y and the value of n.
It would give you the coefficients of the 
resulting polynomial. I was especially 
happy that I could get the list to scroll
by pressing < > keys. I made one game, a
cat and mouse type game with a timer and a
score counter.

Wow why am I making this so long. No one 
will read this.

I just finished my first semeser at college
and my first CS class had us learning Java.
It was insanely fun. It sounds so pretentious 
but I loved to help people in that class.
I finished the assignments early and spent
the rest of the time before the due date
helping my classmates because the TAs were
not so easy to get ahold of. I had basically
encountered every error or issue by the time
I had finished my assignment so it was easy 
to help out. The coolest thing I made was
probably a basic photoshop program. It could
crop (using the given parameters), flip
horizontally and vertically, and change an 
image to greyscale. This "accomplishment" is
severely diminished because it was an 
assignment that literally everyone else did 
too. 

I'm going to stop now because this is 
excessive.
